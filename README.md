## Prompt Configuration

Currently, prompts are statically defined to maintain simplicity in the application design. If you're interested in implementing a dynamic prompt feature, we encourage you to create a pull request. Here's a basic overview of how you might approach this:

1. **Identify the Static Prompts**: Locate the section in the code where prompts are defined, and consider how these could be made configurable. 

2. **Implement Dynamic Prompts**: Create a system that allows users to input or modify prompts via the user interface or an external configuration file.

3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new functionality to ensure that dynamic prompts work as intended and do not introduce any bugs.

4. **Documentation Updates**: Update this README and any other relevant documentation to reflect changes made to the prompt configuration process.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- **Dependency Errors**: Ensure that Node.js and npm are properly installed. Use `node -v` and `npm -v` to check your versions.

- **Failed to Start Server**: Verify that your `.env` file is correctly configured with your API key. Double-check the structure of your secrets.

- **CORS Issues**: If you run into cross-origin request issues, check your browser's console for detailed error messages.
